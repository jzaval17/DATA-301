        "\n",
        "The dataset contains information about 2206 passengers and crew members aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank on April 15, 1912. The Titanic dataset is typically used as a classification dataset. The key target variable is usually \"survived,\" which is a binary outcome indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the disaster. Consequently, many analyses and predictive models built on this dataset focus on classifying passengers into these two groups based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore the distributions of key variables, compute medians, and create visualizations to better understand the data.\n",

        "**Learning Outcomes & Objectives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Outcomes:**  \n",
        "  - Gain proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques using Python.\n",
        "  - Learn how to compute and interpret descriptive statistics (e.g., median) and visualize data distributions (histograms, KDE, box plots).\n",
        "  - Understand how to analyze relationships between variablesâ€”especially using appropriate correlation measures for classification (like point biserial correlation). Kindly read material on correlation and its different types based on the type of variable.\n",
        "  - Develop insights into socio-economic differences and survival patterns within the Titanic dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Objectives:**  \n",
        "  - Explore the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns in survival outcomes.\n",
        "  - Apply visualization techniques to compare distributions (e.g., fare differences across classes) and analyze categorical vs. continuous relationships.\n",
        "  - Use EDA as a foundation to inform feature engineering and subsequent predictive modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment will provide a clear roadmap for understanding the data and the analytical techniques essential for effective EDA.\n",
